## Things You Should Know

* The project took me 4 hours.

* You will notice I started working on an implementation of redux-logic. I couldn't finish because I didn't have the time for it but I dediced to leave the redux-logic files in the project anyway in case you'd like to check.

* The CSS is suboptimal. I would work on the margins/day cell sizing, the weekday header and general look and feel.


Hope you like the project! Any questions you might have message me about it.
